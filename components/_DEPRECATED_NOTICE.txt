⚠️ DEPRECATED COMPONENTS - MIGRATED TO GOOGLE ADK

All files in this directory are deprecated and replaced by the ADK-based system.

For new development, use:
- adk_agents/ package (Google ADK-based implementation)
- run_simulation_adk.py (ADK-based simulation runner)

Mapping:
- gemma_agent.py → adk_agents/gemma_agent_adk.py
- agent_recruiter.py → adk_agents/dynamic_recruiter_adk.py
- simulation_rounds.py → adk_agents/three_round_debate_adk.py
- decision_aggregator.py → adk_agents/decision_aggregator_adk.py
- multi_agent_system.py → adk_agents/multi_agent_system_adk.py
- rate_limit_manager.py → Handled by ADK framework

These files are kept for:
- Backward compatibility
- Comparison testing
- Reference implementation
